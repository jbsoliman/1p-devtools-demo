# 1p-devtools-demo

## To do:


- An npm application that is checked into source control (e.g. Git) that consumes secrets, deployed via AWS.

- Two sets of secrets, one for development and one for production, both saved in 1Password.

- 1Password 8 installed locally with SSH agent and commit-signing set up, with configured keys.

- 1Password CLI installed with the gh (GitHub) setup (involves having the gh CLI installed) and connected to 1Password 8.

- A simple CI/CD flow (similar to this) building and deploying the application to prod.
